# Graph-Algorithms---Scheduling-Tasks
- written in java;
- almost finished(some final touches may be needed, but all functionalities are working properly)

Source files are located in package  "src/com/company" ;
- IDE: Intellij IDEA
- lab4-pb2.png contains details about the representation I used for the tasks and their durations

Pseudocode source:

The "Critical path method" it's described from page 27 and there are 2 representations : by arc and by vertex ;
The second one is the easiest one to understand, though, in my implementation the task is represented as a mix of vertex and edge ;
A implementation by vertex would have been ideal and probably easiest .
